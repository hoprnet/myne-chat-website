    <h3>Privacy statement HOPR</h3>
    <PElement>
      We are committed to protecting your privacy.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      HOPR Association is not able to view or de-anonymize users of the HOPR
      network, even if we wanted to or would be forced to. But protecting your
      privacy goes further than the HOPR software - we limit the collection and
      storing of personal information as much as possible. This privacy
      statement summarizes where, how and why we do need access to some personal
      information and what we do to protect you as good as we can.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      Keeping your information secure is one of the reasons the HOPR Association
      will never sell ads. In this notice, you can read about the information we
      collect from you when you visit https://hoprnet.org/ and other HOPR
      Association subdomains (e.g. https://network.hoprnet.org)
      <b>“Websites”</b>, interact with HOPR Association managed node addresses
      on HOPR testnets or main HOPR network, or operate a node on HOPR testnets
      or main HOPR network. You can also read in this statement how we use such
      information. If you have any questions or concerns, you can email us at
      privacy@hoprnet.org.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      In this privacy statement we inform you about possible rights you are
      entitled to. Such rights depend on the data protection laws applicable to
      us. Therefore, you may have further rights than set forth in this privacy
      statement or certain rights may not be accessible to you. If you do not
      provide the information requested from us, we will not be able to inform
      you about our activities, the functionality of the Websites may be limited
      and the operation of a node by you may not be possible.
    </PElement>
    <h3>1. What information do we collect about you?</h3>
    <h3>When you visit our Website(s)</h3>
    <PElement>
      We do not collect information about you, your device or your internet
      connection such as IP address when you visit our Websites and we also do
      not use any cookies or other tracking technologies. We only collect
      aggregate information about the subpages of our Websites that are being
      visited in general from which country, at what time and which links lead
      you to our page. All this information is separated and not linked in one
      dataset to make it difficult to single out individual users.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      The reason why we collect this information is to optimise our internet
      presence as well as for internal statistical purposes. It is within our
      legitimate interest to process such information to offer you
      well-functioning Websites.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      To collect the information mentioned above, we use Fathom Analytics.
      Fathom Analytics is a website analytics software that tracks and reports
      aggregate Website traffic without compromising on your privacy. Fathom
      only reports on aggregates, so no information specific to the Website
      visitor is ever tracked or recorded. You can opt-out of tracking by the
      Fathom software by enabling {"Do Not Track"} in your browser settings. For
      more information, see their data collection policy:
      https://usefathom.com/data/
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      Unfortunately, today's web is ill suited at protecting your connection
      metadata and therefore some personal metadata such as your IP address,
      from where you access our Websites, when and using what devices and
      software does leak to a range of third parties. At HOPR, we are using
      state of the art web technologies and services that get access to such
      information which is completely normal for a modern web technology stack.
      Specifically, the following third parties get access to some personal
      connection metadata:
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      1. Before you see our Websites, you enter the domain name such as
      hornet.org in your browser. This domain name is resolved into an IP
      address using the Domain Name System (DNS). Your browser will contact a
      DNS cache server that is managed by your internet service provider or a
      third party such as Cloudflare or Google. These DNS cache servers might
      log your request and learn your IP address and what domain you are about
      to access. The logging policies of these third parties are out of our
      control and we must therefore warn you that you are likely to be logged
      somewhere, potentially also from the USA.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      2. After resolving our domain name into an IP address, your browser is
      requesting our website from the webserver at the indicated IP address.
      That means, your internet service provider (ISP) and related
      intermediaries are able to see and potentially store logs about the fact
      that your IP address accessed our website at the given time. They also
      know what other web services you and everyone else connected to the same
      router were accessing before and after that.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      3. To improve the performance and availability of our Websites we are
      using the popular Content Distribution Network Cloudflare. Cloudflare is
      storing a cached version of our Websites and delivers it to you. Just like
      DNS cache servers and your ISP, the IP logging policy of Cloudflare is out
      of our control and you should assume that Cloudflare knows when you
      accessed our website and from where.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      4. Before our content gets cached by Cloudflare, it is hosted by Vercel.
      Thus, when accessing our Websites, your content might also get served by
      Vercel and Vercel is able to see and potentially store logs about the fact
      that your IP address accessed our website at the given time.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      5. Some parts of our Websites’ content are directly loaded from your
      browser. That means that the parties behind the web servers from which
      that content is loaded might also see and log your IP address and learn
      that you are loading content from them that is related to HOPR.
      Specifically, our Websites loading content from the following sources:
    </PElement>
    <PElement className="sub-paragrahp">
      <b>a. Google</b> is serving some fonts that are used on our Websites and
      for performance reasons we are loading them directly from Google servers
      so Google gets to know when and from where you are loading these fonts.
    </PElement>
    <PElement className="sub-paragrahp">
      <b>b.Substack</b> is our email newsletter service and when you sign up for
      the newsletter, Substack sees not only your personal email address but
      also the IP address from where you are sending the request.
    </PElement>
    <PElement className="sub-paragrahp">
      <b>c. Medium</b> is our blog service provider and as the blog is
      automatically integrated in our website, Medium learns about your IP
      address when that HOPR-specific content is loaded by your browser.
    </PElement>
    <PElement className="sub-paragrahp">
      <b>d. YouTube (by Google)</b> serves HOPR videos and by integrating these
      videos in our website, they learn about your IP address when that
      HOPR-specific videos are loaded by your browser.
    </PElement>
    <h3>When you register for our newsletter</h3>
    <PElement>
      When you register for our newsletter, we collect your email address.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      We use {"double-opt-in"} in order to ensure you are the owner of the email
      address entered. We only use this data for the delivery of our newsletter
      if you have agreed to receive it. You can unsubscribe from our newsletter
      at any time via a link in each respective e-mail. You can also send us a
      message to privacy@hoprnet.org so that we can delete you from our mailing
      list. We will send you our newsletter based on your consent.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      We use Mailjet for newsletter that is provided by Mailgun Technologies,
      Inc. Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of
      can be retrieved under https://www.mailjet.com/privacy-policy/.
    </PElement>
    <h3>
      When you run a node and interact a HOPR Association managed node address
    </h3>
    <PElement>
      When you are running a node on the HOPR testnets and interact with any
      node run by the HOPR Association, we automatically receive your IP
      address, and all messages you send to the node, including low level error
      messages your interaction with the node generate and the technical output
      of your node, that we will store on our server to debug the HOPR software
      protocol, identify errors and make improvements to the project as a whole.
      It is within our legitimate interest to process such information to
      improve the HOPR software protocol and enable you to run a node on a
      well-functioning network.
    </PElement>
    <h3>When you run a node</h3>
    <PElement>
      By starting a node of the HOPR network (including the HOPR testnets), you
      will be connected to our bootstrapping node that collects your IP address
      and connects you to other nodes of the HOPR network. The collection of
      such information is required that we can connect you with other HOPR
      nodes. The lawfulness of the data processing for this purpose lies in the
      fulfilment of our commitment to you to enable and connect you to the HOPR
      network.
    </PElement>
    <h3>When you provide feedback or engage in bounties via online forms</h3>
    <PElement>
      We sometimes ask HOPR users to voluntarily provide feedback or engage in
      bounties for which you then provide feedback via online forms. These
      online forms might contain personal information from log files that
      include folder names which might include your username on your computer
      which might reveal your personal name and your IP address. We sometimes
      also ask you to provide your Twitter username. The collection of such
      information is required to improve the HOPR network.
    </PElement>
    <h3>2. Are we sharing information with third parties?</h3>
    <PElement>
      We use your information only described in this privacy statement. We do
      not share your information with third parties except when it’s necessary
      to complete the functions of our Website(s), to offer you our the
      newsletter, enable you to interact with other HOPR nodes ran by the HOPR
      Association and to connect you with other nodes of the HOPR network though
      the bootstrapping node. We will only disclose your information if we are
      compelled to do so by mandatory applicable law and only to the minimum
      extent possible.
    </PElement>
    <h3>3. Do we transfer information abroad?</h3>
    <PElement>
      We are entitled to transfer your information to third parties (contracted
      service providers) abroad for the purpose of the data processing described
      in this privacy statement. These are bound to protect data to the same
      extent as we are. If the level of data protection in a country does not
      correspond to that in Switzerland or Europe, we will contractually ensure
      that the protection of your information corresponds to that in Switzerland
      or Europe at all times.
    </PElement>
    <h3>
      4. Data surveillance by US authorities is a risk that we try to limit
    </h3>
    <PElement>
      For the sake of completeness, if you are residing or domiciled in
      Switzerland, we would like to point out that in the USA there are
      surveillance measures by US authorities which generally allow them to get
      access to all information that has been transferred from Switzerland to
      the USA. This is done without differentiation, limitation or exemption
      based on the objective pursued and without any objective criterion that
      would allow limiting the access to the information and subsequent use
      thereof by US authorities to very specific, strictly limited purposes that
      could justify the interference associated both with access to and use of
      information. In addition, we would like to point out that in the USA there
      are no legal remedies available for the persons concerned from Switzerland
      that would allow them to gain access to the information concerning them
      and to obtain its correction or deletion, or that there is no effective
      legal protection against general access rights of US authorities. We
      explicitly draw your attention to this legal and factual situation in
      order to enable an informed decision to consent to the use of your
      information.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      We would like to point out to users residing in an EU member state that,
      from the point of view of the European Union, the USA does not have an
      adequate level of data protection, partly due to the issues mentioned in
      this section. Insofar as we have explained in this privacy statement that
      recipients of data (such as Google) are based in the USA, we will ensure
      that your information is protected at an appropriate level by our service
      providers, either through contractual arrangements with these companies or
      any other permitted instrument.
    </PElement>
    <h3>5. What are your rights on your information?</h3>
    <PElement>
      The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and other
      countries’ privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      You can view, edit, or delete your information for the newsletter online.
      For any other data, please get in touch with us. If you wish to confirm
      that we are processing information about you, or to have access to
      information that we may have about you, please contact us at
      privacy@hoprnet.org. Reasonable access to your information will be
      provided at no cost to you by us. If access cannot be provided within a
      reasonable time frame, we will provide you with a date when the
      information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will
      provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      You may also request information about: the purpose of the processing; the
      categories of information concerned; who else outside us might have
      received the data from us; what the source of the information was (if you
      did not provide it directly to us); and how long it will be stored. You
      have a right to correct (rectify) the record of information about you
      maintained by us if it is inaccurate. You may request that we erase that
      data, cease or restrict processing it, subject to certain exceptions. In
      case of automated decision making, including profiling, you may request
      human intervention or challenge a decision.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      In many countries, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the
      appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we
      process your information. When technically feasible, we will — at your
      request — provide your information to you or transmit it directly to
      another controller.
    </PElement>
    <h3>6. How do we keep your information safe?</h3>
    <PElement>
      We have put in place systems to safeguard the information you provide to
      us. We will never provide access to our databases to any third party,
      except to the extent necessary as described in section 2 (are we sharing
      information with third parties?).
    </PElement>
    <h3>7. How long do we keep your information?</h3>
    <PElement>
      We process and store the information about you only for the period
      necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted
      by laws or regulations to which we are subject to. The criteria used to
      determine the period of storage of your information is the respective
      statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the
      corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer
      necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a
      contract.
    </PElement>
    <PElement>
      If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period
      prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator
      expires, the information is routinely blocked or erased in accordance with
      legal requirements.
    </PElement>
    <h3>8. Who is responsible?</h3>
    <PElement>
      The controller of the processing of your information is:
